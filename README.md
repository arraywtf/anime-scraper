## Requirements
Python 3.9+ and the following package:
```
pip install requests
```

## Usage
Go to [AniList Developer Panel](https://anilist.co/settings/developer) and create new client, make sure you have an account on there.

When it asks you for the redirect URL put this `https://localhost/`

After that copy your client `ID` and the `Secret`, and paste it in the python program.

Also if you overload their API and get a fine that's not my fault - just saying..
